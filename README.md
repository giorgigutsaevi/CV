## Giorgi Gutsaev

I am an aspiring Junior Developer, who is always hungry to expand my programming skills and conquer new realms of technology! Being an immensely curious individual, I like to go into solving problems with my eyes fully open, and translate my innate passion for this captivating industry into a clean, tested and reusable code. 

I studied at Makers Academy from November 2021 to February 2022, where I learnt the core principles of creating full-Stack web applications using JavaScript and Ruby. Also, my experience at Makers has taught me to always follow best working practices and effectively collaborate with others. I have documented my learning journey @Makers, so if you are interested what my life was like during those 12-weeks of bootcamp, please feel free to click [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/Makers-Learning-Portfolio). 

I have a BSc in Hospitality & Business Management, and a background in marketing & events, experience which made me a highly effective team-player and a communicator, that positively translates into impactful problem solving. During my time at Makers, I got enchanted by coding, and I am excited to bring my passion, enthusiasm to a new role, where I can both improve, learn and diversify my skillset.

## Technical Experience

#### Makers Academy (Nov 2021 to Feb 2022)

- JavaScript (currently learning React)
- Node
- Ruby 
- Rails
- Full Stack Web Development
- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile methodologies
- Version Control (Git/Github)
- Jest, RSpec, Mocha/Chai
- Deploying on Heroku
- HTML, CSS (Bootstrap, Bulma)
- Configuring APIs (Twilio/Guardian)
- Majority of projects were paired/team. Some individual work with strong focus on processes and TDD.

## Skills

#### Initiative

- I am a huge advocate for effective communication. During my time at VTB Bank Georgia, I suggested to introduce a chat-based communication (Microsoft Teams) to avoid mass email traffic within the organisation, which eventually increased day-to-day productivity. Also, frequently during Pair programming at Makers, I would be vocal about our current or future objectives, hence defusing the tension. 
- I am a naturally curious person, constantly hungry to learn more about the world, research novelties and new technologies in the tech industry. I frequently listen to podcasts about a variety of topics, including tech, science, and history. 
- I am currently learning React, Redux & MongoDB with the overall aim to master the MERN stack. 

#### Problem Solving

I enjoy solving problems with a systematic and divide-and-conquer approach, which stems from my previous professional roles. When tackling any problem, especially code related, I like to deconstruct the problem, divide it into smaller chunks and try to write it down on a piece paper. This helps me visualise what needs to be done, especially since I am a visual learner. For example, during the Acebook challenge (essentially creating a Facebook clone), another pair asked me if I could help them to solve an issue they were having with a feature that allows the users to see how many people liked a certain post. Even though the project was primarily written in Ruby on Rails, I guided them to use JavaScript and explained several CSS magic tricks to solve the issue.

#### Ability to perform under pressure
In my former role as an events coordinator at Active Communications International, I was often tasked to manage and oversee the planning and execution of three or more simultaneous events, frequently being scheduled in different time-zones. Despite the immense pressure, I was able to thrive under such circumstances and was able to deliver exceptional results, with clients often times buying the tickets on spot for the next year's iteration of the same event/conference.
