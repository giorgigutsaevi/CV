## Giorgi Gutsaev

I am an aspiring Junior Developer, who is always hungry to expand his programming skills and conquer new realms of technology! Being an immensely curious individual, I like to go into solving problems with my eyes fully open, and translate my innate passion for this captivating field into clean, tested and reusable code. 

I studied at Makers Academy from November 2021 to February 2022, getting insights of the core principles of the most popular programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, and really solidifying best practices that are used in the industry. 

I would love to work at a company where I can continue to both improve, learn and diversify my skillset!
