## Giorgi Gutsaev

I am an aspiring Junior Developer, who is always hungry to expand my programming skills and conquer new realms of technology! Being an immensely curious individual, I like to go into solving problems with my eyes fully open, and translate my innate passion for this captivating industry into a clean, tested and reusable code. 

I studied at Makers Academy from November 2021 to February 2022, where I learnt the core principles of creating full-Stack web applications using JavaScript and Ruby. Also, my experience at Makers has taught me to always follow best working practices and effectively collaborate with others. I have documented my learning journey @Makers, so if you are interested what my life was like during those 12-weeks of bootcamp, please feel free to click [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/Makers-Learning-Portfolio). 

I have a BSc in Hospitality & Business Management, and a background in marketing & events, experience which made me a highly effective team-player and a communicator, that positively translates into impactful problem solving. During my time at Makers, I got enchanted by coding, and I am excited to bring my passion, enthusiasm to a new role, where I can both improve, learn and diversify my skillset.
